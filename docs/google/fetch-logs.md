This document describes how to read data from the Certificate Transparency
logs.

# API and server behaviours
Certificate Transparency logs make their entries available through the
`get-entries` endpoint, as defined in
[RFC6962](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6962#section-4.6).

When fetching entries from a log, always keep in mind that:

 1. `Logs MAY restrict the number of entries that can be retrieved per
 "get-entries" request`: this means that if you make a
 `get-entries?start=10&end=40`, request the server might return a smaller slice,
 such as `start=10&end=20`. The number of entries returned might vary between
 requests, so always check how many entries each response contains, to adjust
 the start index of the next request. In Trillian with a CT personality (which
 powers most of the CT logs at the time of writing), there are two main
 mechanisms that limits the number of entries in responses:
     - Static: a log will never return more than X entries per reponse, where
     X is set by the log operator.
     - Dynamic: the server might [trucate responses to align the last leaf
     index](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go/blob/afde1b22ba618518e928a0379546db969803afb9/trillian/ctfe/handlers.go#L979-L988)
     of a reponses on a geometric sequence. This increases the likelihood that
     two different requests lead to the same response, hence making caching more
     effective.

 2. Serving infrastructure might rate limit requests to protect logs, based on
 various parameters. Clients should react to rate limits, with exponential
 backoff for instance, in order to release pressure on the servers until they
 can serve a steady stream of entries. Rate limiting is dynamic and can vary 
 over time, so always re-evaluate the number of queries your clients sends based
 on the most recent server reponses. Rate limits are often due to:
     - network DoS protection mechanisms specific to each log operator
     - a log server quota system, such as [Trillian's](https://github.com/google/trillian/blob/master/quota/quota.go)

# Self-hosted tools
Here is a list of currently known tools to fetch entries from logs. This table
attempts to provide a high level overview of them, with info on:
   - Storage: how the entries are stored
   - Parallelism: whether it allows making multiple queries to the same log in parallel
   - Dynamic ranges: whether it checks the number of entries in `get-entries` responses and adjusts the start of following
   requests
   - Backoff: how it reacts to HTTP `429 Too Many Requests`
