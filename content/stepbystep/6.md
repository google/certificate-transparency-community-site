The SCTs accompany the certificate throughout its lifetime. A server must deliver the SCT with the certificate during a TLS handshake. (A TLS handshake is when two sides of an encrypted communication verify each other and agree which encryption algorithms and keys to use. Here, that process begins when a user goes to an HTTPS website, and the web server responds to the HTTPS request.)
