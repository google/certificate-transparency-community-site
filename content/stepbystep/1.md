A certificate ties together a domain and a public key. Certificate Transparency works with Web PKI/SSL certificate system, providing transparency and verification. The append-only log is tamper-proof, the User agent checks that logs are cryptographically consistent, and the Certificate Authority's monitors will check for suspicious logs.
