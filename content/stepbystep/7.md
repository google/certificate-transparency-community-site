Some browsers, like Chrome and Safari, help enforce CT.

Both the number of logs, and the selection of logs a CA chooses to log, is determined by user agent policy. Both [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT205280) and [Chrome](https://github.com/chromium/ct-policy#chromium-certificate-transparency-policy) user agents require at least 2 SCTs, depending on certificate lifetimes.
