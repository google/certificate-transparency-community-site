A CA receives a request for a certificate from a domain owner. It checks that the domain owner has the right to request the certificate, and creates a precertificate, which ties the domain to a public key. A precertificate contains all the information a certificate does. It also has a poison extension so that user agents wonâ€™t accept it. Precertificates help break a deadlock in CT. Before a CA can log a certificate, the certificate needs an SCT (Signed Certificate Timestamp). But for the certificate to get an SCT, it needs to have been submitted to a log.
